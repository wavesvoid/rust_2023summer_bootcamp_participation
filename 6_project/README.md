Step 6: Capstone project
=========================

Congratulation! You've almost done it!

Create a portfolio project using Rust within a one-week timeframe. The project should showcase your proficiency in Rust, demonstrate your coding style, and highlight your problem-solving skills. The goal is to create a functional project that can be presented to potential employers or shared with the programming community.

## Step 6.1: Agree on your capstone project

Choose a project idea that is suitable for implementation within a one-week timeframe. Consider the complexity and feasibility of the project.

Consider this project as an opportunity to learn and grow your skills in Rust. Challenge yourself by exploring new Rust features, libraries, or patterns, and incorporate them into your project where appropriate.

If you're having trouble finding a suitable subject for your project, don't hesitate to ask your mentors for suggestions.

> ❗️ You have to approve the subject of the project with your mentor.

## Step 6.2: Get approvement of basic implementation from the first mentor

Focus on designing and developing a minimum viable version of your project, rather than a fully finished product, given the limited time frame. Don't worry about achieving perfection in your implementation at this stage. Just ensure you get your mentor's approval on your work.

## Step 6.3: Get 4 reviews from peers and mentors

Teamwork is crucial in our program, as is respecting senior team members and acknowledging the strengths of your peers. You are required to obtain four reviews of your work from your peers and mentors. These reviews should incorporate diverse perspectives: at least one should be from a peer and at least one from a mentor outside your immediate group. You're encouraged to consider and apply the majority of the feedback you receive in these reviews.

## Step 6.4: Present your project

In a successful team, members feel comfortable being vulnerable and open to feedback. As such, you are expected to present your project to your peers and mentors. This will allow you to receive more feedback, further facilitating your growth and learning.

Congrats! At this stage, you already have a minimum portfolio.
