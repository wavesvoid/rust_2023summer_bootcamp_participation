### Mission

Our boot camp's mission is to cultivate **well-trained professionals** who can immediately add value to any team and are equipped with the skills to tackle real-world challenges. Graduates will earn professional certificates, which significantly reduce the risk for companies that might otherwise hire under-prepared individuals. We are here to mentor and guide anyone who needs it.

However, our focus is not on:

- Providing an entertaining experience where participants pretend to be Rust developers.
- Offering just an introductory overview of the subject matter.
- Creating content where ample high-quality resources already exist online.
- Delivering lectures.
- Providing unnecessary hand-holding or 'babysitting.'

These are **non-goals** of the boot camp.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin the certification program, you should have a solid understanding of Rust and Git/GitHub. We strongly recommend completing the [Rust Book]. It's also beneficial if you have completed [Rustlings] and [Exercism], and have some hands-on practice. If you're transitioning from another programming language, you'll also find this certification program particularly useful.

### Perspective

**Choosing to participate** in our boot camp means embarking on an intensive, **fast-paced journey** of learning, focusing on the critical areas of information technology. The boot camp's accelerated pace is designed to be the most effective method for rapidly acquiring new skills. Usually, **boot camps outperform** traditional university courses, pet projects, and even on-the-job training, especially when starting without a strong foundation in these crucial skills. A pet project simply does not challenge you in the same way a boot camp does, pushing you outside of your comfort zone. Boot camps also hold an advantage over commercial projects: you have much more freedom and time to build up missing skills, and our curriculum encourages you to master one skill at a time, never pushing you too far beyond your current abilities.

Participants in the boot camp will join closely-knit small groups. Meetings within these groups will take place four times a week, excluding weekends. These meetings provide an opportunity for dynamic discussion, mutual learning, and the answering of any questions you might have. Additionally, participants can expect to answer insightful questions posed by their mentors, fostering a proactive learning environment. You can also make new friends and acquaintances who can help you with your career -- after all, **networking is a pillar of success**.

Our learning process is meticulously designed to enhance skills daily, leveraging the most exceptional learning materials available. We do not produce content unless there is no adequate resource available online. Our philosophy rests on utilizing state-of-the-art tools and **premium learning materials**, rather than creating substandard content ourselves. We furnish an interactive platform for tracking progress, ensuring a well-defined path towards skill enhancement and achievement.

Participants will also be challenged with designing, developing, and presenting a **capstone project**. This project provides a fantastic opportunity to apply the skills learned throughout the boot camp in a practical, impactful way.

Finally, a **comprehensive assessment** will be conducted at the end of the certification program. Upon successful completion, participants will earn a certificate. This certificate is more than just a document; it's a testament to your ability to utilize best practices and write idiomatic code, which employers highly value. Imagine the doors that could open with this certificate in hand!

Join us in this boot camp and fast-track your IT career to new heights. The journey might be intense, but the reward is immeasurable.

### Your group

Each participant has been assigned to a specific group, with each group having 2 mentors. If you're in the morning cohort, your meetings will typically be scheduled for 10:00. For those in the evening cohort, meetings are most likely at 18:30. Mentors might shift slightly time of meetings.

### Routines

Expect to join calls with your fellow learners and mentors four days a week. During these group sessions, we strongly encourage you to **voice your questions** and engage actively in discussions. Be prepared to answer queries posed by your mentor. We also recommend turning on your **video camera** to foster a more personable and engaging experience for both participants and mentors. Please join meetings **5 minutes before** they start to show respect to peers and mentors.

### Topology of curriculum

In most contexts, the terms chapter and step can be used interchangeably.

The boot camp is divided into four parts:

1. General part: chapters 0, 1, 2, 3
2. Specialization part: chapters 4, 5
3. Capstone project: chapter 6
4. Certification test

At present, we offer only one specialization: "web back-end". The second and third parts can be worked on simultaneously with the first part. And, you should work on the third part in parallel with the second part to meet the deadline.

### Soft and Hard Deadlines

In this boot camp, we implement two types of deadlines: soft deadlines and hard deadlines.

1. **Soft Deadlines**: These are flexible deadlines designed to help keep you on track. Every soft deadline is set for **Thursday** at midnight. We tolerate up to two instances of not meeting a soft deadline. However, if you fail to meet a soft deadline for a third time, this will lead to expulsion.
2. **Hard Deadlines**: These are strict deadlines that must be adhered to. Each hard deadline is set for **Sunday** at midnight. Failing to meet a hard deadline will result in immediate expulsion.

Each chapter of our program has its own deadline. Please note that some chapters may take more than one week to complete. We use a week as our standard unit of measurement.

We encourage you to meet all deadlines to maximize your learning experience and successfully complete the boot camp.

> 💡 Advice: Tasks 4.4 and 6 are non-trivial and will easily take a week of work. Make sure you reserve more than a few days for these tasks.

### Calendar

The calendar is your ally. Utilize it and allocate at least **20 hours per week** to immerse yourself in the program and adhere to the deadlines. Make it a habit to **check the calendar** at least once a week. All meetings and deadlines are marked there. Please note that all deadlines are set for Thursdays. Missing these hard deadlines can significantly hinder your progression in the program, so be sure to respect them.

Please arrive at each meeting **prepared and ready for discussion**. Your homework and tasks should be completed before the meeting, not after. Mentors expect you to come prepared, and their role is to help deepen your understanding of the concepts.

As soon as you complete one chapter, start the next without delay. This will help you stay on track. Treat the boot camp as a job or a competition, not just as entertainment. To succeed, it's essential to **study regularly** and avoid taking more than one day off at a time. A loss of a couple of days can set you back significantly, and recovery may be stressful. So, take care of yourself and manage your time wisely.

### Honor code

We ask you to complete the assignments independently and not to share your own work. Since you will receive certificates at the end of the course, we will carefully check your work for Plagiarism. A person who uses the work of another person and another person **both will be expelled** if such an incident occurs.

### Capstone project

You will be tasked with creating a portfolio project using Rust within a one-week timeframe. The project should highlight your proficiency in Rust, showcase your coding style, and demonstrate your problem-solving skills. The objective is to build a functional project that can be presented to potential employers or shared within the programming community.

Select a project idea that can be effectively implemented within a **one-week timeframe**. Consider the project's complexity and feasibility. You are expected to present your project to your peers and mentors, which enables you to receive comprehensive feedback, enhancing your growth and learning experience.

### Certificate

If you complete all tasks on time, successfully present your capstone project, and achieve a high score on the certification test, you will earn a **professional certificate**. We're dedicated to ensuring our certificate is recognized both in Ukraine and internationally.

### Certification Test

Our certification process is meticulously designed to maintain the highest levels of integrity and credibility. We implement stringent measures to deter cheating and ensure a fair testing environment for all participants.

During the certification test, participants will be [supervised by a proctor][certification test]. We require participants to use two cameras and share their desktop throughout the test to prevent any unauthorized communication. In addition, we will monitor all active processes on the participant's computer at the beginning and during the test to curb any fraudulent activities.

It's important to note that passing the certification test is challenging due to its intricate and tricky questions. Each participant is granted **only one attempt** to pass the test. However, a condensed version of the test will be publicly available for practice. Participants who complete the first or second part of the program ahead of others, or those whose capstone project receives the most likes from mentors during presentation, will be awarded an extra attempt. We recommend utilizing available online quizzes as part of your **preparation for the certification test**. This method will help you thoroughly understand the topics related to any questions you might stumble upon.

Any attempt to cheat during the certification test will lead to immediate expulsion from the boot camp.

> 💡 Advice: It is beneficial to go through as many online quizzes as possible before taking the certification test. Mastery of rustlings and exorcism drills, as well as reviewing others' code, is recommended, as the certification test evaluates not only your understanding of concepts but also your ability to read and comprehend code swiftly.

### Get help from mentors and peers

You are welcome to **ask questions** in our chat without asking to share a solution.

Please be **respectful and polite** to peers and mentors.

> 💡 Advice: mutual support is our *value*. Don't underestimate the importance of soft skills.

### Expulsion

There are a few potential reasons for expulsion from the group, which include but are not limited to:

- [Plagiarism]
- Failing to meet more than 2 [soft deadlines][deadlines]
- Failing to meet any [hard deadline][deadlines]
- Systematic violation of the rules
- Choosing to withdraw on your own accord

> 💡 Advice: If circumstances require you to leave the group prematurely, please do so with respect and professionalism. We encourage you to provide a brief, public explanation or acknowledgment prior to your departure. Please remember, we're all human and understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise. Rest assured, there will be no hard feelings if you must leave the boot camp early.

## Getting Started

Wait for the invite to your new repository from [our bot](https://github.com/1tbot). For each exercise, you'll need to create separate pull requests. Then, when the reviewer checks and approves your pull request, you can merge it into the master/main branch. After that, the exercise will be considered done.

1. [Our bot](https://github.com/1tbot) will create a private fork of the main [Rust Incubator repository](https://github.com/rust-lang-ua/rust_incubator) in [our organization](https://github.com/rust-lang-ua) and invite you.

2. Also, your mentors will already be in the repository.

3. Stay Up-to-Date.

This course is continually evolving, and it's important to stay updated with the latest changes.

To keep your fork up-to-date, follow these commands:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/rust-lang-ua/rust_incubator.git
git fetch upstream master
git merge upstream/master --allow-unrelated-histories
```

To fetch the latest changes, use:
```bash
git fetch upstream master
git merge upstream/master
```

To stay aware of any new changes, consider [watch this repository on GitHub](https://github.com/rust-lang-ua/rust_incubator/subscription) or tracking it via [RSS subscription](https://github.com/rust-lang-ua/rust_incubator/commits/master.atom).

If you get the error `fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories` add option `--allow-unrelated-histories`  flag to the last command.

## Submitting Solutions

For each chapter or step of the bootcamp, you should create and submit a separate [PR (pull request)][PR]. Make sure to give your PR a [relevant title](https://github.com/rust-lang-ua/rust_incubator/blob/master/faq.md#--how-should-i-name-pr). After you've completed your pull request, please remove any markers like "NOT READY", "DRAFT", or "WIP" from the title. In the description of your pull request, remember to tag all your mentors.

Before merging the pull request into the main branch, you need to receive approval from at least one mentor. If more than one mentor has reviewed your Pull Request and requested changes, you must receive approval from all involved mentors.

Each step of the bootcamp is a [Cargo workspace member][workspace], meaning you can run and test it from the project root using commands like `cargo run -p step_1_8`. We highly recommend using tools like [rustfmt] and [Clippy] while writing your [Rust] code.

Never hesitate to reach out to your mentor or lead with questions. However, be aware that you may not always receive a direct answer. Instead, they may guide you towards a path for your own exploration and discovery. Remember, in this learning journey, it's usually the mentor or lead who asks the questions, expecting thorough and precise responses from you.
