### Prerequisites

Before you begin the certification program, you should have a solid understanding of Rust and Git/GitHub. We strongly recommend completing the [Rust Book]. It's also beneficial if you have completed [Rustlings] and [Exercism], and have some hands-on practice. If you're transitioning from another programming language, you'll also find this certification program particularly useful.

### Perspective

**Choosing to participate** in our boot camp means embarking on an intensive, **fast-paced journey** of learning, with a focus on the critical areas of information technology. The boot camp's accelerated pace is designed to be the most effective method to acquire new skills swiftly. If your ambition is to gain practical, hands-on skills that can make an immediate impact. Usually **boot camps outperform** traditional university courses, pet projects, and even on-the-job training, especially when starting without a strong foundation in these crucial skills.

Participants in the boot camp will be divided into closely-knit small groups. Meetings within these groups will occur four times a week, excluding weekends. These meetings are an opportunity for dynamic discussion, mutual learning, and answering any questions you might have. Additionally, participants can expect to answer insightful questions posed by their mentors, fostering a proactive learning environment.

Our learning process is meticulously designed to enhance skills daily, leveraging the most exceptional learning materials available. We do not produce content unless there is no adequate resource available online. Our philosophy rests on utilizing state-of-the-art tools and **premium materials**, rather than creating substandard content ourselves. We furnish an interactive platform for tracking progress, assuring a well-defined path towards skill enhancement and achievement.

Participants will also be challenged with designing, developing, and presenting a **capstone project**. This project provides a fantastic opportunity to apply the skills learned throughout the boot camp in a practical, impactful way.

Finally, a **comprehensive assessment** will be conducted at the end of the certification program. Upon successful completion, participants will earn a certificate. This certificate is more than just a document; it's a testament to your ability to utilize best practices and write idiomatic code that employers will value highly. Imagine the doors that could open with this certificate in hand!

Join us in this boot camp and fast-track your IT career to new heights. The journey might be intense, but the reward is immeasurable.

### Your group

Each participant has been assigned to a specific group, with each group having 2 mentors. If you're in the morning cohort, your meetings will typically be scheduled for 10:00. For those in the evening cohort, meetings are most likely at 18:30. Mentors might shift slightly time of meetings.

### Routines

Expect to join calls with your fellow learners and mentors four days a week. During these group sessions, we strongly encourage you to **voice your questions** and engage actively in discussions. Be prepared to answer queries posed by your mentor. We also recommend turning on your **video camera** to foster a more personable and engaging experience for both participants and mentors. Please join meetings **5 minutes before** they start to show respect to peers and mentors.

### Topology of curriculum

In most contexts, the terms chapter and step can be used interchangeably.

The boot camp is divided into four parts:

1. General part: chapters 0, 1, 2, 3
2. Specialization part: chapters 4, 5
3. Capstone project: chapter 6
4. Certification test

At present, we offer only one specialization: "web back-end". The second and third parts can be worked on simultaneously with the first part. And, you should work on the third part in parallel with the second part to meet the deadline.

### Soft and Hard Deadlines

In this boot camp, we implement two types of deadlines: soft deadlines and hard deadlines.

1. **Soft Deadlines**: These are flexible deadlines designed to help keep you on track. Every soft deadline is set for **Thursday** at midnight. We tolerate up to two instances of not meeting a soft deadline. However, if you fail to meet a soft deadline for a third time, this will lead to expulsion.
2. **Hard Deadlines**: These are strict deadlines that must be adhered to. Each hard deadline is set for **Sunday** at midnight. Failing to meet a hard deadline will result in immediate expulsion.

Each chapter of our program has its own deadline. Please note that some chapters may take more than one week to complete. We use a week as our standard unit of measurement.

We encourage you to meet all deadlines to maximize your learning experience and successfully complete the boot camp.

> 💡 Advice: Tasks 4.4 and 6 are non-trivial and will easily take a week of work. Make sure you reserve more than a few days for these tasks.

### Calendar

The calendar is your ally. Utilize it and allocate at least **20 hours per week** to immerse yourself in the program and adhere to the deadlines. Remember to **check the calendar** at least once a week. All meetings and deadlines are marked there. Please note that all deadlines fall on Thursdays. Do not miss the hard deadlines - they are crucial to your progression in the program.

### Honor code

We ask you to complete the assignments independently and not to share your own work. Since you will receive certificates at the end of the course, we will carefully check your work for Plagiarism. A person who uses the work of another person and another person **both will be expelled** if such an incident occurs.

### Capstone project

You will be tasked with creating a portfolio project using Rust within a one-week timeframe. The project should highlight your proficiency in Rust, showcase your coding style, and demonstrate your problem-solving skills. The objective is to build a functional project that can be presented to potential employers or shared within the programming community.

Select a project idea that can be effectively implemented within a **one-week timeframe**. Consider the project's complexity and feasibility. You are expected to present your project to your peers and mentors, which enables you to receive comprehensive feedback, enhancing your growth and learning experience.

### Certificate

If you complete all tasks on time, successfully present your capstone project, and achieve a high score on the certification test, you will earn a **professional certificate**. We're dedicated to ensuring our certificate is recognized both in Ukraine and internationally.

### Certification Test

Our certification process is meticulously designed to maintain the highest levels of integrity and credibility. We implement stringent measures to deter cheating and ensure a fair testing environment for all participants.

During the certification test, participants will be [supervised by a proctor][certification test]. We require participants to use two cameras and share their desktop throughout the test to prevent any unauthorized communication. In addition, we will monitor all active processes on the participant's computer at the beginning and during the test to curb any fraudulent activities.

It's important to note that passing the certification test is challenging due to its intricate and tricky questions. Each participant is granted **only one attempt** to pass the test. However, a condensed version of the test will be publicly available for practice. Participants who complete the first or second part of the program ahead of others, or those whose capstone project receives the most likes from mentors during presentation, will be awarded an extra attempt.

Any attempt to cheat during the certification test will lead to immediate expulsion from the boot camp.

> 💡 Advice: It is beneficial to go through as many online quizzes as possible before taking the certification test. Mastery of rustlings and exorcism drills, as well as reviewing others' code, is recommended, as the certification test evaluates not only your understanding of concepts but also your ability to read and comprehend code swiftly.

### Get help from mentors and peers

You are welcome to **ask questions** in our chat without asking to share a solution.

Please be **respectful and polite** to peers and mentors.

> 💡 Advice: mutual support is our *value*. Don't underestimate the importance of soft skills.

### Expulsion

There are a few potential reasons for expulsion from the group, which include but are not limited to:

- [Plagiarism]
- Failing to meet more than 2 [soft deadlines][deadlines]
- Failing to meet any [hard deadline][deadlines]
- Systematic violation of the rules
- Choosing to withdraw on your own accord

> 💡 Advice: If circumstances require you to leave the group prematurely, please do so with respect and professionalism. We encourage you to provide a brief, public explanation or acknowledgment prior to your departure. Please remember, we're all human and understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise. Rest assured, there will be no hard feelings if you must leave the boot camp early.

## Getting Started

Wait for the invite to your new repository from [our bot](https://github.com/1tbot). For each exercise, you'll need to create separate pull requests. Then, when the reviewer checks and approves your pull request, you can merge it into the master/main branch. After that, the exercise will be considered done.

1. [Our bot](https://github.com/1tbot) will create a private fork of the main [Rust Incubator repository](https://github.com/rust-lang-ua/rust_incubator) in [our organization](https://github.com/rust-lang-ua) and invite you.

2. Also, your mentors will already be in the repository. 

3. Stay Up-to-Date.

This course is continually evolving, and it's important to stay updated with the latest changes.

To keep your fork up-to-date, follow these commands:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/rust-lang-ua/rust_incubator.git
git fetch upstream master
git merge upstream/master --allow-unrelated-histories
```

To fetch the latest changes, use:
```bash
git fetch upstream master
git merge upstream/master
```

To stay aware of any new changes, consider [watch this repository on GitHub](https://github.com/rust-lang-ua/rust_incubator/subscription) or tracking it via [RSS subscription](https://github.com/rust-lang-ua/rust_incubator/commits/master.atom).

If you get the error `fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories` add option `--allow-unrelated-histories`  flag to the last command.

## Submitting Solutions

Each chapter/step of the boot camp must be submitted as a separate [PR (pull request)][PR] with a [relevant title](https://github.com/rust-lang-ua/rust_incubator/blob/master/faq.md#--how-should-i-name-pr). Upon completion, mark the step as complete in the README's curriculum. Note that each step is a [Cargo workspace member][workspace], which means you can run/test it from the project root (i.e. `cargo run -p step_1_8`). We recommend using tools like [rustfmt] and [Clippy] while you're writing your [Rust] code.

Don't hesitate to approach your mentor/lead with questions. However, keep in mind that you may not receive a straightforward answer. Instead, you'll be guided towards a direction for your own exploration. Remember, in this learning journey, _it is primarily the mentor/lead who poses the questions, expecting comprehensive and precise responses._
