Create a new route in the app from the previous exercises. The route should return the profile picture of the requested student. Youâ€™ll use the [gravatar API](https://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/images/) to receive the profile picture. Extend your test suite(use wiremock to mock the gravatar API). In case of errors, return the HTTP error codes(or something better if you wish).
