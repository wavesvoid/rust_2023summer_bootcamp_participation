Create an application that returns info stored in a db in the json format. The db should have the following structure.

Student’s table:

| Uuid | Full name | Age | Registration Date | List of courses (should be another table) |
|------|-----------|-----|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|

Write basic tests for the app(don’t overdo it).
