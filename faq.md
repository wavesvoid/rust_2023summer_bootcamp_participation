## FAQ

#### - What is PR?

PR is an abbreviation for [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

#### - How should I name PR?
Each task is a separate PR on a separate branch. The name of the PR should be in the following template: task_`task_number`

Examples:
- "task_0" (task of the zero section), 
- "task_1_3" (first section, third task), 
- "task_5_3_11" (5th section of the 3rd task, 11th subtask), 
- "task_2" (final task of the 2nd section).

#### - When and how are the meetings held?

Meetings are held four times a week on weekdays (except Tuesday) according to your group's schedule. The meeting lasts about 1 hour. All appointments will be in your calendar. Attendance at the first meeting is mandatory.

#### - Will the meeting be recorded?

No, there will be no recordings of the meetings, so do your best not to miss them.


#### - How do I start completing tasks?

[Our bot](https://github.com/1tbot) will create a private fork of the main [Rust Incubator repository](https://github.com/rust-lang-ua/rust_incubator) in [our organization](https://github.com/rust-lang-ua) and invite you. For more information on how to configure the received repository, see the [instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang-ua/rust_incubator/blob/master/orientation.md#getting-started).

#### - How and where do I send Pull Requests of completed tasks?

In your private fork, create a separate branch for each task. In the corresponding branch, complete the task and create a PR to your main master branch. You can choose only one reviewer per PR. So don't forget to tag all your mentors in the comments to the PR

#### - When is a task considered completed?

A task is considered completed when you've made a Pull Request, and it has been reviewed and approved by one of the reviewers.

#### - What should I do if the task is unfinished? Should I open a PR?

Yes, you should open a PR as soon as possible and indicate "Not Ready" in the title.

#### - Can I complete the course assignments only on weekends?

You should dedicate more than 20 hours a week to your studies to achieve quality results. In three months of intensive coursework, you can achieve what might otherwise take two years of independent practice. If you confine your study time to the weekends only, you would need to study for 10 hours a day. It's better to evenly distribute your study time throughout the week.

#### - Where should I answer the questions in the first chapter?

You can leave the answers under the question itself by editing your own md-file.

#### - Where can I ask for help?

Firstly, ask your peers in the Bootcamp's chat. You can also post your questions in the Telegram [chat of our community](https://t.me/rustlang_ua), the official [forum](https://users.rust-lang.org/). [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) works well for simpler queries. However, your solutions must be original. Anyone found sharing or copying solutions will be expelled.

#### - What is the best way to ask questions?

It's preferable to have your code in the [playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/). This way, mentors and peers don't have to spend extra time recreating the problem.

#### - Is the Telegram chat moderated?

At the initial stage, we don't want to limit communication in the chat, nor do we want to divide it into sub-chats. We encourage people to get to know each other. After the familiarization phase, we may introduce stricter moderation rules in the future, if necessary. For now, however, you must respect other chat participants and are not allowed to be offensive.


#### - What is the motivation of mentors to mentor?

All mentors are employed, and many of them have their own companies and are in a good position to hire a talented participant. Moreover, mentoring helps to improve their own knowledge, and all of our mentors have a natural desire to help other people.

#### - Do we cooperate with IT companies in any way?

We are making a lot of efforts to involve companies in interviews with bootcamp graduates and hopefully we will get there. We currently have 4 partner companies: TacansLab, AI Edge Lab, Intellias, and Near.

#### - What should I do if I find mistakes in the repository?
We encourage you to open an __issue__ if you see any problems.

#### - How can I incorporate changes from the main repository?

Add the main repository as a remote.

```bash
# Add the remote
git remote add upstream git@github.com:rust-lang-ua/rust_incubator.git
# Fetch the changes from the repository
git fetch --all
# Merge the changes
git merge upstream/master
```

*If you get the error `fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories` add option `--allow-unrelated-histories`  flag to the last command.*

> NOTE: it is possible that the mentioned commands may result in numerous merge conflicts that would be tedious to resolve by hand.
> This might happen if the repository is modified in some way before it is synced with the template.
> If the changes are not significant, it is probably easier to try again from the start. Otherwise, here is one way to fix such an issue:

#### - What to do if you merged with `--allow-unrelated-histories`, but there are too many merge conflicts?

1. You need to restore the state of your repository before the unsuccessful merge.

Beacuse of how `--allow-unrelated-histories` merges commits, the only actual way to do so is to make a brand new clone of your repository from the state it was saved on your GitHub.
If you didn't publish your progress before attempting to merge, unfortunately, you are going to lose that progress.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/your_repo.git
cd your_repo
```

Since this is a new clone, we are going to need to setup a new remote for the template repository.

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/rust-lang-ua/rust_incubator.git
```

2. Create a new branch and reset it to the state of the `upstream/master`

```bash
# fetch the data from the template repository
git fetch upstream master
# create a new brench and switch into it
git checkout -b template
# reset the branch to the state of upstream/master
git reset upstream/master
```

Now, instead of a bunch of conflicts, you have unstaged changes, which are much easier to work with.
In my case, I just had to discard all of the changes(correct state of the repository took priority). Your situation might be different.

3. Run `git status` and choose what to keep.

```bash
# this will show you all the unstaged changes
git status
# if you wish to keep some of the changes, you may add them
git add file1 file2 ...
# or, to keep all of the changes,
git add *
# if you wish to discard a particular change, run
git restore file1 file2 ...
# or you may discard all of the changes
git restore *
```

Once you're done with staging the changes, commit them. You may do so in multiple steps, if you wish.

```bash
git commit
```

4. Finally, you may merge the branches

```bash
git checkout master
git merge template -Xtheirs --allow-unrelated-histories
```
Done! At this point, all of your commits have common history with the template repository, and therefore ordinary

```bash
git fetch upstream master
git merge upstream/master
```

should suffice when it comes to updating your repository, and it should work without any unexpected problems or '--allow-unrelated-histories'.

If you are satisfied with the result, you can remove the `template` branch and publish your changes to GitHub.

```bash
git branch -D template
git push
```
