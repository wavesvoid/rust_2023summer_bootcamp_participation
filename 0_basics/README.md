Step 0: Become familiar with Rust basics
========================================

__Estimated time__: 4 days

Read through [Rust Book], [Rust FAQ], and become familiar with basic [Rust] concepts, syntax, memory model, type and module systems.

Polish your familiarity by completing [Rust By Example] and [rustlings].

Read through [Cargo Book] and become familiar with [Cargo] and its workspaces.

After completing these steps, you should be able to answer (and understand why) the following questions:
- What memory model [Rust] has? Is it single-threaded or multiple-threaded? Is it synchronous or asynchronous?
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
<!-- xxx : box vs vector -->
>>>>>>> upstream/master
- What runtime [Rust] has? Does it use a GC (garbage collector)?
- What statically typing means? What is a benefit of using it? Weak typing vs strong typing? Implicit / explicit?
- What are generics and parametric polymorphism? Which problems do they solve?
- What is nominative typing and structural typing? What is difference?
- What are traits? How are they used? How do they compare to interfaces? What are an auto trait and a blanket impl? Uncovered type? What is a marker trait?
- What are static and dynamic dispatches? Which should I use, and when? What is monomorphisation?
- What is a crate, module and package in Rust? How do they differ? How are the used? What is workspace?
- What is cloning? What is copying? How do they compare? What is for trait drop? What is special about the trait?
- What is immutability? What is the benefit of using it? What is the difference between immutability and const?
- What are move semantics? What are borrowing rules? What is the benefit of using them?
- What is RAII? How is it implemented in [Rust]? What is the benefit of using it?
- What are lifetimes? Which problems do they solve? Which benefits do they give?
- What is an iterator? What is a collection? How do they differ? How are they used?
- What are macros? Which problems do they solve? What is the difference between declarative and procedural macro?
- How code is tested in [Rust]? Where should you put tests and why?
- What is special about slice? What is layout of Rust standard data types? Difference between fat and thin pointers?
- Why [Rust] has `&str` and `String` types? How do they differ? When should you use them? Why str slice coexist with slice?
- Is [Rust] OOP language? Is it possible to use SOLID/GRASP? Does it have an inheritance? Is Rust functional language?

After you're done notify your lead in an appropriate PR (pull request), and he will exam what you have learned.
